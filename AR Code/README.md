Google Model Viewer is a web-based tool that allows you to create, edit, and preview 3D models and their corresponding code in real-time. Remix provides a user-friendly interface for designing and customizing 3D models, and integrates with Google's Model Viewer to allow for easy previewing and testing.

Steps we used to achieve our AR Functionality: 

1. Open Remix: Open the Remix website in your web browser.

2. Create or import a 3D model: We created a png image for the coupon code in Canva and then converted it to .glb and .usdz models. 

3. Add the Model Viewer code: Add the HTML code for Google's Model Viewer to the Remix editor(glitch), along with the source URL for your 3D model file. Source code of our editor: https://glitch.com/~deekshita-geeksforgeeks

4. Preview and test: Preview your model in the Model Viewer by clicking the "Preview" button in the Remix editor. This will launch a new tab in your web browser, where you can interact with and test your model.

5. Save and export: Once you are satisfied with your model, save your changes in Remix and export the code for use in your web project.
